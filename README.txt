Comp 20, Fall 2014
Assignment 1 by Colin Hamilton

The submission consists of the three html pages index.html, bio.html, and resume.html, as well as
the css page master.css.
All aspects of the assignment have been properly implemented.
I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment.
I spent approximately 7 hours on this assignment - 3 hours writing/copy the bio and resume,
and 4 hours dealing with formatting and syntax.
