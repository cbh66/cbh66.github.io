    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p class="narration">Colin Hamilton was born in New Hampshire in 1994, and moved to Harwich, Cape Cod, MA in 1999.  He learned from a young age to sail and play golf, and continued these interests throughout his childhood, joining the sailing and golf teams in high school.  Through middle school and high school, he also involved himself in drama, choir, mock trial, and the National Honor Society.</p>
    <p class="narration">From a young age, Colin enjoyed most subjects, but found himself particularly drawn to science, math, and technical subjects.  He could rarely articulate what he preferred about them, but believed the reasons to include the fact that: they are organized and methodical; they rely on finding and matching patterns, like solving puzzles; and they have immediate real-world implications that can both explain the natural world and aid in manipulating it.  Throughout high school, he became fascinated with physics, particularly quantum physics and astrophysics (dealing with both the extremely small and extremely large, respectively).  He read book after book on the subjects, endlessly fascinated by the bizarre facts of the real world.</p>
    <p class="narration">Colin possessed enthusiasm and a drive to succeed throughout his school career, and he graduated as valedictorian of the Harwich Class of 2012, the last graduating class of the school district.  He enrolled at Tufts University the same year, originally intending to major in Physics, due to the wonder it aroused within him.  He found quickly, however, that he greatly preferred his Intro to Computer Science course to his Intro to Physics course.  He continued to take classes in both disciplines, but found the former more compelling.  Again, he found the reasons difficult to explain, but pointed to the creativity and problem-solving skills that Computer Science seemed to employ more, as well as the fact that it produced concrete results.  Physics, on the other hand, seemed to be mostly formulae and observation, and its results, though interesting, were not so immediately useful.  He decided to continue in Computer Science and declared it as his major at the end of his sophomore year.  He continues to maintain a strong interest in physics, but prefers learning higher-level concepts to the low-level details.</p>
    <p class="narration">Colin is currently exploring the field of Computer Science with great enthusiasm (though is also considering a second major in Mathematics).  He has been a Comp 11 TA for three semesters, and has found the job to be incredibly rewarding.  Colin spends much of his spare time writing programs to test new concepts he's learned.  He is also involved with Tufts Futurism Society and Tufts Gospel Choir.</p>
